# 📌 Sorting Algorithms in Java

This repository contains implementations of commonly used **sorting algorithms in Java**.  
It is created to help understand the working, logic, and performance of different sorting techniques, which are fundamental concepts in computer science and important for coding interviews.

## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Java file with clear and beginner-friendly logic.

## 🧠 What is a Sorting Algorithm?

A sorting algorithm is a technique used to arrange elements of a list or array in a specific order (usually ascending or descending).  
Sorting improves efficiency in searching, data processing, and problem solving.

## 🔍 Algorithm Explanation

### 🔹 Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Time Complexity:  
- Best Case: O(n)  
- Average Case: O(n²)  
- Worst Case: O(n²)  

Best suited for learning purposes and very small datasets.

---

### 🔹 Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.

Time Complexity:  
- Best Case: O(n)  
- Average Case: O(n²)  
- Worst Case: O(n²)  

Efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets.

---

### 🔹 Merge Sort
Merge Sort uses the divide and conquer approach by dividing the array into smaller parts, sorting them, and then merging them.

Time Complexity:  
- Best Case: O(n log n)  
- Average Case: O(n log n)  
- Worst Case: O(n log n)  

Efficient for large datasets.
